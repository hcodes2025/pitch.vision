          Based on firsthand experience, I’ve found that emerging technologies - from GPUs and exascale systems to quantum computing - hold little value without practical, accessible applications. This principle is especially true for AI today. What ultimately gives these technologies meaning is not their theoretical potential but how they empower people through well-crafted and accessible tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest lies in building adaptive, always-learning personal AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          This vision includes AI systems that live on wearables, run locally, and evolve with their user - embodying a quiet intelligence that is always on, always learning, and deeply aligned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next evolution of AI must be personalized, adaptive, energy-efficient, and safe. While transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential, they also expose significant challenges, particularly in computational power cost, reliability, and safety. These limitations demand rethinking beyond scaling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I design adaptive, efficient, and aligned systems - whether they run on transformers, spiking neurons, hyperdimensional vectors, or technologies yet to be imagined.        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          To help solve some of the challenges facing LLMs, I’ve explored spiking neural networks (SNNs) as one potential component - not as an endpoint but as a demonstration of what energy-efficient, interpretable intermediary intelligent layers might look like within a broader framework.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          My work focuses on building proof-of-concept applications that explore these hybrid possibilities across verticals. I aim to demonstrate practical paths toward safer and more adaptive AI.

        <p>
          These projects are stepping stones towards the goal that reflects my commitment to building intelligent systems that are personal and accessible. I’m eager to bring this piece to teams shaping the future of AI - through collaboration, partnership, or leadership.

          The current optimization techniques lack in enabling truly lightweight and responsive systems. This motivates exploration into radically different architectures better suited for edge and real-time intelligence - including biologically inspired alternatives, such as Spiking Neural Nets (SNNs).
        </p>
        <p>
          No single architecture will define the future of AI. My interest lies in building systems that are adaptive, efficient, and aligned with human values — whether they run on transformers, spiking neurons, hyperdimensional encodings, or something yet to be invented.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that spirit, I’ve explored spiking neural networks (SNNs) as one potential component — not as an endpoint, but as a demonstration of what energy-efficient, interpretable gates might look like within a broader framework.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary><span class="sem">Why SNNs? Why not just prune transformers?</span></summary>
          <p>
            Quantization, model distillation, and pruning offer incremental efficiency gains — but they remain bound to a dense, compute-heavy paradigm. These methods reduce FLOPs, yet preserve continuous activation and global attention — making them neither edge-ready nor suitable for wearables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) rely on sparse, event-driven computation. Neurons fire only when needed, resulting in architectures that are not just smaller, but fundamentally more efficient — echoing biological energy frugality.
          </p>
          <p>
            I explore SNNs as complementary building blocks to transformers — a path toward embedding adaptive alignment and constraint directly into AI systems, at a fraction of the energy cost.
          </p>
